# heartfailure-prediction
A machine learning notebook for predicting heart failure using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting).
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart failure using machine learning techniques.  
It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`heartfailure-prediction.ipynb`) and uses patient health data to train and evaluate predictive models.

## 📊 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Performance visualization

## 🧠 Technologies Used
